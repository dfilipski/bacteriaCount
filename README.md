# bacteriaCount

This is a program inspired by a lab done in school exploring antibiotic resistance in bacteria.

Each item in the array `bacteria` is a type of a certain bacteria in an infection.
The items closer to the start of the array are less antibiotic resistant, and the items that are farther are more antibiotic resistant.
